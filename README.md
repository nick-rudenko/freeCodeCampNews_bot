### About me

Greetings, fellow human ðŸ––

I am a tiny [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot. My [creator](https://twitter.com/rdnkta) loves
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and wants a way to get new [articles](ttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/)
automatically whenever they are posted rather than visiting the page every day. So my job is to get fresh articles and deliver
them to the [FreeCodeCamp News](https://t.me/freecodecamp_news) channel.

I am happy with my postman job. It's better than just [passing the butter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCP3HisyW0) ðŸ‘€

### What do I use

- Node.js (my engine)
- Express (of course)
- telegraf (for easier work with Telegram API)
- cheerio (for scraping)
- SQLite (to remember what I posted before)
- cron (to not forget to check for new articles ðŸ˜…)

### Oh, and I am hosted on [here](https://freecodecamp-news-bot.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku
